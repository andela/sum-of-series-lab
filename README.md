# Sum Of Series Lab
+ You are to create a function, *`SumOfSeries(arr)`* to take an array of numbers (series) as the only argument, and return the sum of the series if the to prototype function is called with the value n (where n will be the number of items in the series).
+ *For example:* if arr contains `[1, 3, 5, 7]` the output should be 100 when the to prototype function is called with 10.
+ The conditions for this lab are as follows:
  + The series can be AP or GP
  + The series will contain a minimum of 3 numbers
  + The series may contain negative numbers or fractions.


## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\sum-of-series.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
